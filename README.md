# InstallSlyvina


If you plan to use Slyvina yourself, you may get a bit astray.
Slyvina has libraries, tools and applications.

The libraries are the code of Slyvina itself, the tools are tools specifically made to be used in the development of apps using Slyvina and applications are the games and apps written with Slyvina.

This script should make your life a bit easier. Make sure you have an empty folder with only this script in it (so in stead of cloning this repository it can be handier just to download this script. This also prevents repository conflicts). Although it's written for PowerShell, it should also work in the normal Linux Shell.

Make sure that "git" is installed on your system, and this script should take care of the rest. Please note, an empty "Apps" folder will be created. It will contain nothing at all, but if you ever clnse any app of mine using Slyvina, you can best clone them there (unless instructions in the documentation of the app's repository strictly say otherwise). 

Now 'Install.ps1' should install all repositories and 'Update.ps1' should make sure all repositories are up to date!
